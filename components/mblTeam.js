                Javier Campos earned his Architecture Degree from the University
                of British Columbia after having completed an undergraduate

                Architects where, as lead designer, his projects were widely
                published and garnered numerous awards — including Canadian
                Architect and Lieutenant Governor Medals in Architecture. His
                work adopted a green agenda early and has included off the grid
                projects since 2001. He became LEED certified in 2004. Javier is
                also involved in Public Art and has won several competitions
                with Artist Elspeth Pratt in Vancouver. Javier served on the
                board of the Contemporary Art Gallery for six years and as well
                being the current president of the Heritage Vancouver Society,
                where he established an award winning outreach series on issues
                around Heritage.

                Javier Campos earned his Architecture Degree from the University
                of British Columbia after having completed an undergraduate
                degree in Art History. Previously he was at Acton Ostry
                Architects where, as lead designer, his projects were widely
                published and garnered numerous awards — including Canadian
                Architect and Lieutenant Governor Medals in Architecture. His
                work adopted a green agenda early and has included off the grid
                projects since 2001. He became LEED certified in 2004. Javier is
                also involved in Public Art and has won several competitions
                with Artist Elspeth Pratt in Vancouver. Javier served on the
                board of the Contemporary Art Gallery for six years and as well
                being the current president of the Heritage Vancouver Society,
                where he established an award winning outreach series on issues
                around Heritage.
